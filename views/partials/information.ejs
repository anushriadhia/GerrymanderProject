<h4>Measuring Compactness</h4>
<h5>The Original Gerrymander</h5>
<p>The term Gerrymandering refers to the act of manipulating the boundaries of voting districts to achieve some political advantage. The term was coined during tenure Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry, who in 1812 redrew the voting districts for the Massachusetts State Senate to favor his own party. One district caught the attention of the Boston Gazette, who published a political cartoon likening the district’s shape to that of a salamander and labeling the phenomenon “The Gerry-mander” after the Governor.</p>

Compactness and Geographic Gerrymandering
Compactness measures have been widely used to assess geographic gerrymandering. Although it is generally accepted that legislative districts should be “compact” the defintion of compactness has proved elusive. Numerous, sometimes conflicting, measures of compactness across a number of theoretical dimensions have been proposed in the academic literature. These measures are typically based on comparing geometric features of the district (e.g. perimeters, areas) to the features of a related base geometric object (e.g. minimum bounding circle, convex hull).

Here we provide six of the most frequently used measures of compactness used by academic researchers: (1) Polsby-Popper (Polsby and Popper, 1991); (2) Schwartzberg (1965); (3) Reock (1961); (4) Convex Hull; (5) X-Symmetry; and (6) Length-Width Ratio (C.C. Harris, 1964). As no one threshold for determining if a district has been gerrymandered exists we provide three cutoffs from which to compare scores from different districts (1) the scores for the original gerrymander, (2) the state mean, and (3) the state median.

Polsby-Popper
The Polsby-Popper (PPPP) measure (polsby & Popper, 1991) is the ratio of the area of the district (ADAD) to the area of a circle whose circumference is equal to the perimeter of the district (PDPD). A district’s Polsby-Popper score falls with the range of [0,1][0,1] and a score closer to 1 indicates a more compact district.
